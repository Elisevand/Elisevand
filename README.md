# 👋 Hi, I'm Elise

I’m a bioengineer with a strong passion for computer science and technology.  
Currently studying at 42 Belgium, I’m diving deep into C, C++ and low-level programming, while always looking to connect my two main interests: **informatics** and **environmental challenges**.  

## 🔥 Highlighted Projects

- **[Master’s Thesis](https://github.com/Elisevand/Statistical_Analysis_of_Maize_Phenotyping)** → A pipeline to standardize and integrate phenotyping data from multiple European platforms.  
- **[Minishell](link-to-your-repo)** → A Unix shell implementation in C (builtins, pipes, redirections, process handling).  
- **[Cub3D](link-to-your-repo)** → A raycasting-based 3D engine with real-time rendering (MiniLibX).  
- **[C++ Modules 00–08](link-to-your-repo)** → A full set of progressive projects covering modern C++ concepts (OOP, inheritance, templates, STL).  

## 💡 What I enjoy

- Building concrete solutions from scratch  
- Exploring the intersection between data, biology, and computer science  
- Constantly learning and pushing myself out of my comfort zone
